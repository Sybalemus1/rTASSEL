Description:
    The aim of rTASSEL is to provide an R front-end for the
    Java program, TASSEL. TASSEL is a software package used to evaluate
    trait associations, evolutionary patterns, and linkage disequilibrium.
    Additionally, this software allows for a number of powerful statistical
    approaches to association mapping such general and mixed linear modelling.
